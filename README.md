Demo Project
------------

Create a system to create custom search filters against a database of call records.

Note: I created an Attribute on the Web API controller CallsController::GetCalls that will randomly throw errors to show the app presents errors to the end user in a nice manner. This sometimes causes errors to pop up on page load, but using the refresh grid icon or searching will reload the grid.

I will be using the Issues tracker to show progress and have something for my commits to go against. I am used to using FogBugz & JIRA so it feels wrong not to have something to put my commits against in case there are issues with the code. This way we can see what the requirement was, what the changes were and possibly where/when the problem happened.
